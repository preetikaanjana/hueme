# ðŸŒˆ HueMe â€“ Your Emotions, in Living Color

HueMe is a mood-tracking web app that lets you reflect on your emotionsâ€”one color and emoji at a time. With a tap, your feelings paint a personalized emotional calendar that helps you notice patterns, understand yourself, and grow.

##  Why HueMe?

We often live in fast-forward, unaware of how we really feel. HueMe turns that emotional noise into a clear, visual rhythm using colors and emojis. Itâ€™s not just about trackingâ€”HueMe helps you **see** your emotions and **honor** them.
